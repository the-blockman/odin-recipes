    Description

  <p>
    Here's a very simple salmon recipe that starts with a marinade of 
    soy sauce, red wine, ginger, and black pepper. 
    Grill over hot coals for about 5 minutes per side, 
    basting frequently with extra marinade.
    "This seafood treat is best prepared over a charcoal fire, 
    but in bad weather the oven broiler will do," says Alan Harasimowicz. 
    "The secret is in the marinade."
