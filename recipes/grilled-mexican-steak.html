        Add toasted cumin seeds, jalapenos, garlic, pepper, 
        lime juice, and salt to a blender, along with oil and cilantro, 
        and pulse until smooth. "It was awesome on the steak and 
        chicken too," says ptwoosley. "I used ground cumin instead of 
        seeds for convenience and it was still great. I also love it 
        hot so I added a little cayenne to the marinade."

        Steps
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Toast the cumin seeds in a medium saute pan over 
          medium-low heat for 5 minutes, or until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a blender, combine the cumin seeds, jalapenos, garlic, 
          pepper, lime juice, and salt. Pulse the blender to finely 
          chop ingredients. Add the oil and cilantro and puree until 
          smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lightly score both sides of the meat with a knife so that 
          the marinade will penetrate. Place the meat in a 
          large plastic bag or bowl, pour in the marinade, 
          and coat well. Marinate in the refrigerator for 
          24 to 48 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the meat from the marinade and discard the 
          remaining marinade. Cook on high, 1 to 2 minutes per side, 
          to sear the meat. Turn the heat down to low and cook for an 
          additional 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until the it has 
          reached the desired doneness.
